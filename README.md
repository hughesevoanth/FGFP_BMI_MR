## Research Question
Does elevated levels of adiposity, as measured by BMI, have an observational and causal effect on gut microbiome variation?

### Objective
A one-sample MR of BMI(GRS) to microbiome traits, using the FGFP data set. 

Here we will be evaluating the observational and causal relationship between BMI-G(R)S and each mirobiome trait (PA, AB, diversity, and enterotypes), individually. 

### Study
1. Flemish gut flora project (FGFP)
	* data from the lab of Jeroen Raes.
2. N = ~2200
		
### Study Data
1. microbiome traits
2. clinical/questionarie data
	* BMI
	* age
	* sex
	* SES
	* smoking
3. genotype data for BMI associated SNPs
	* Yengo et al; n = 656
	* Pulit et al; n = 670
